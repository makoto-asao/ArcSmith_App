    "editorial_notes": "【Round 2での修正点】\n1. Viral Architectの指摘: 冒頭のフックを「この動画を見ているあなた」への直接的な警告に変更し、視聴維持率を底上げ。最後に「関連動画」への視覚的誘導を追加。\n2. The Whispererの指摘: 鉄瓶の飢饉描写や刀の狂気を、単なる事実ではなく「絶望の残響」として情緒的にリライト。日本特有の「湿り気」を強調。\n3. The Visionaryの指摘: Midjourneyプロンプトに「1970年代のJホラー映画（35mm、粒状感）」の質感を指定し、単なる静止画ではなく物語性を感じさせるライティング（Chiaroscuro）を追加。全13シーンの1対1対応を徹底。",
