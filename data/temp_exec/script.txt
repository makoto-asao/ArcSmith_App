A lonely road under moonless sky
Whispers follow every step
A figure emerges from the fog
Her kimono worn and soaking wet
She clutches something close
A soft cry pierces the night
Please hold my child just for a moment
Her eyes beg a silent plea
The weight feels strangely warm
Then a chill spreads through your arms
The tiny form grows heavy cold
A rough stone replacing soft skin
You try to drop it but cannot
It clings with a spectral grip
Her mournful wail now fills the void
He is mine forever more
The mother's curse never ends
A stone heart beating in your arms
